# snooker_general

A CLI representation of the snooker.org API with a few more things.

(still at a very early stage of development)

#### some things that are troubling the continued development of the project
* hard to get any info about ongoing matches when the aren't any really
* most things you can get only by ID and the api provides no list of IDs to reference from
* i'll most probably have to scrape a few other snooker websites for some functions to be complete
* i'll not stop trying though
